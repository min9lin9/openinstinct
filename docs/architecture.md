# OpenInstinct architecture

One macOS launchd daemon (`openinstinctd`, a Bun runtime running
`daemon/src/main.ts`), one menu-bar app, one tiny Accessibility helper. All state
under `~/.openinstinct`. No root, SIP on, no third-party binaries other than `gjc`.

```
~/.openinstinct/
  bin/openinstinctd      bun runtime (copied, keeps its TCC identity across installs)
  bin/oi-presence        typing / read-receipt helper (Swift, AX)
  bin/bun → openinstinctd  so the vendored gjc shim (#!/usr/bin/env bun) resolves
  lib/                   daemon source + node_modules, copied by install.sh
  config.json            optional owner handle, name, model, limits

  env                    provider keys (0600), loaded before any SDK import
  state.db               SQLite: cursors, deliveries, children, monitors, receipts, assistant work, notifications
  session/               cwd of the main SDK session (never the repo)
  children/{work,sessions,journal}/
  memory/                git repo, gajae-way layout

  logs/daemon.ndjson     structured log, rotated by retention
  run/control.sock       NDJSON control socket (0600)
```

## Boot and lanes

`env-bootstrap.ts` is the first import: it loads `~/.openinstinct/env` into
`process.env` *before* `@gajae-code/coding-agent` is evaluated, because the SDK
injects its own auto-imported credentials at module load and the owner's file
must win. Then `startDaemon()`:

1. **Bootstrap machine** probes `config` and AI credentials. Credentials are the
   only core-lane gate. A missing or malformed `config.json` does not block
   startup: `core-config.ts` applies per-scope product defaults and logs the
   fallback. When an owner handle is configured, it also probes Full Disk Access
   (`chat.db`) and Automation (an `osascript` query to Messages); those probes
   are skipped for a chat-only install. It re-probes every 5 s and publishes
   status on the socket.
2. **Store** opens `state.db` (migrations in `store/migrations.ts`).
3. **Control server** listens on the socket immediately, including while the
   core is waiting for credentials, so the panel can show why.
4. When the credentials probe passes (or is unknown), the **core lane** starts:
   the main session, child lifecycle, monitor scheduler/triggers/propagation,
   memory closure, and retention. The Chat hub is available in every bootstrap
   state that the control server can serve.

Bootstrap states are `starting`, `credentials_blocked`, `running`, and
`degraded`. `credentials_blocked` means the core is stopped until an AI account
or managed API key is available. `running` means the core is eligible; it does
not require an iMessage handle. `degraded` means a probe or core start threw;
the existing lanes are left untouched and the next 5-second evaluation retries
the core start.

The core and iMessage lanes have separate lifetimes:

- The **core lane** owns the shared SDK session, children, monitors, memory, and
  chat surface. It gates only on AI credentials and can run with no iMessage
  configuration.
- The **optional iMessage lane** owns the chat.db watcher, delivery service,
  Messages sender, and presence path. It attaches when the core is running, an
  owner handle is configured, and the Full Disk Access probe passes. Automation
  is probed only in this configured path and is surfaced in `status.get`; it is
  needed for Messages sending, while Accessibility controls typing/read
  presence. The lane detaches when the handle is absent, FDA is denied or has a
  probe error, attach fails, the core stops, or the daemon shuts down.

Lane convergence runs at boot, on each 5-second re-probe (for example, after a
permission grant), and immediately after an owner-handle or credential setting
change. No daemon restart is needed to attach, detach, or switch numbers. Every
handle replacement or removal retires the old handle first: the lane is detached,
the session is reloaded, and pending/in-flight ledger rows for that old handle
are expired before a new lane can attach. A same-handle permission detach keeps
those rows for replay; a turn that started detached remains chat-only for its
whole life.

### Log events for lane and routing diagnosis

The primary NDJSON log records these lifecycle and routing events:

- `core_lane_started` and `core_lane_stopped` mark the shared core lifetime.
- `imessage_lane_attached`, `imessage_lane_detached`, and
  `imessage_lane_attach_failed` describe optional iMessage convergence.
- `delivery_skipped_no_imessage_lane` records an owner-bound effect dropped
  because the lane was detached or its generation changed.
- `deliveries_expired_for_handle` records pending/in-flight rows retired with an
  old owner handle.
- `config_missing_defaults_applied` and `config_invalid_defaults_applied` record
  configuration fallback while keeping the core eligible.
- `session_reloaded` records a session reload (including lane/persona changes).
- `router_initial_user_skipped` records the SDK router ignoring a run's own
  initial user message when attributing queued steering.

## Inbound: iMessage and Chat → shared owner turn

The iMessage adapter still polls `chat.db` through `imessage/reader.ts` (read-only,
WAL) from a ROWID cursor. The cursor is bound to a fingerprint of the database
(path + earliest guid); on first contact or identity change it anchors at
`max(ROWID)` and replays nothing — the one-time incident that texted 21 failures
into the owner's own inbox is why. Bodies come from `text` or, on modern
Messages, from the `attributedBody` typedstream (`decodeAttributedBody`). Only
the configured handle is accepted; everything else is dropped silently. Empty /
tapback / U+FFFC-only rows never become turns. This adapter also reads inbound
attachments (≤ 8 MiB) and supplies `PromptImage[]`.

The panel's `chat.send` control verb is the other thin adapter. It accepts text
from the separate Chat window, tags the prompt with `[sent from the Chat window]`
for transcript source recovery, and does not touch `chat.db`, the allowlist, or
Messages presence.

Both adapters call the source-agnostic `OwnerTurnIngress`. It emits the owner
echo, then applies the same pause suppression, steer-when-busy admission, failure
breaker, memory capture, segment flushing, and final handling for either source.
The source only changes routing: iMessage can mark read and use live Messages
presence; panel turns use Chat hub presence. Typing is per-turn presence, not a
periodic status message.

## The main session

`sdk-session/main-session.ts` wraps one `createAgentSession` from the SDK,
reopened over the same transcript file on every daemon start (`SessionManager`).
It is never respawned per message.

- **Serial queue**: turns, reloads, and compactions run one at a time.
- **Steering**: `interruptMode=wait`, `steeringMode=all` — the in-flight tool
  call finishes, then all queued owner texts enter together.
- **Segments**: assistant text is flushed to the owner at every tool-call start
  and every assistant `message_end`, so a turn that thinks–acts–thinks sends
  several short texts instead of one wall at the end. Only owner turns stream;
  internal turns (receipt follow-ups, monitor triage) are silent.
- **Image forwarding**: a `read` of an image path by the agent admits that file
  as an attachment to the owner.
- **Watchdog**: inactivity-based (default 300 s of *no* SDK events), reset by
  streaming, tool calls, and steers. On timeout: abort, or dispose + recreate over
  the same transcript.
- **Compaction**: SDK auto-compaction is off; the daemon compacts at ≥ 50 %
  context after a turn settles.
- **Reload** (`session.reload`): dispose + recreate over the same transcript so
  a changed system prompt takes effect without losing history.
- **System prompt** = gjc defaults, untouched → `persona/GAJAE_SOUL.md` (the
  character, versioned) → `persona/RUNTIME.md` (where it is: iMessage, plain
  text, delegation rules, monitor rules, Chrome profile; `{{ownerHandle}}` etc.
  substituted from config).
- **Custom tools**: `delegate_background`, `send_image`, `child_nudge`,
  `child_status`, `monitor_author`, `memory_search`, `memory_capture`,
  `memory_audit`, `assistant_work_observe`, `assistant_service_monitor`,
  `assistant_local_file`, `assistant_work_status`, `assistant_managed_install`,
  and `assistant_managed_http`. Task/conversational children receive the managed
  local-file tool; monitor children receive observation and read-only
  service-monitor tools. The managed raw-effect gate wraps the actual main and
  child SDK extension lifecycles.
- **Extensions**: `browser/enforce.ts` blocks any `browser` tool call not
  pinned to the dedicated Chrome profile and returns the exact `app` block to
  retry with.

## Assistant work and managed effects

`assistant-work/` and `store/assistant-work.ts` implement a durable ledger for
work items, observations, canonical action revisions, approvals, attempts, and
owner notifications. `assistant_work_observe` accepts only `system` or
`third_party` provenance. A host-side assessment decides whether evidence is
irrelevant, an uncertain proposal, or clear unfinished work worth tracking;
the observation itself never authorizes an effect. `assistant_service_monitor`
can turn the clear case into a service-neutral read-only monitor at a 5-minute
cadence for important/ongoing work or 45 minutes otherwise. Its read-only rule
is cooperative policy, not OS-level confinement.

The registered managed paths are:

- `assistant_local_file` proposes or executes regular-file writes and explicit
  deletes at normalized absolute paths. Host preflight inventories the targets
  and derives the effect class; the model cannot label its own action safe.
- `assistant_managed_install` proposes or executes one exact-version Bun
  package in an absolute work directory. The host owns the Bun path and argv,
  defaults to lifecycle scripts disabled, and inventories the destination
  before and after the one spawn.
- `assistant_managed_http` performs a bounded GET or proposes/executes one exact
  POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE request. Mutations run once without redirects or
  automatic retry, then a separate GET verifies the expected remote state.
- `assistant_work_status` reads work, action, revision/digest, and attempt state;
  it cannot approve or dispatch anything.

The SDK-level managed tool gate also intercepts raw `bash`, mutating browser
calls, and unknown tool effects in both main and child sessions. Raw file
writes/edits are redirected to `assistant_local_file`. Where managed execution
is available, other raw effects are bound to the exact tool name and canonical
input digest, require exact owner approval, persist `effect_started` before the
SDK invokes them once, and settle as `ambiguous` because a tool result is
execution evidence, not independent verification. Observation-only monitor
children fail closed instead. This is a cooperative gate over actual SDK calls,
not an OS sandbox or fake-success wrapper.

Every proposal is identified by an action ID, positive revision, and canonical
SHA-256 digest. Execution must present that exact triple. The executor
re-inspects host state before claim and again before mutation, persists
`effect_started` before invoking the effect, and settles with verified evidence.
An ambiguous post-effect result is reconcile-only: it is not blindly retried.
Ordinary local edits and a recognized dedicated managed install root can use
local policy. Deletes, existing-user-asset changes, core/account changes,
lifecycle scripts, managed HTTP mutations, and opaque raw effects require exact
owner authority or remain blocked. A managed HTTP action marked as an external
message may instead use a currently enabled owner rule whose recipient, topic,
and action all match exactly.

Owner authority is minted only in `OwnerTurnIngress`, after the local Chat socket
or configured iMessage allowlist authenticates the direct owner message. Action
approval/rejection commands are exact, standalone, text-only lines:

```text
/approve ACTION_ID REVISION DIGEST
/reject ACTION_ID REVISION DIGEST
```

The digest is 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters. Attachments, extra words,
unknown actions, and stale revisions/digests are rejected. `supportsManagedApproval`
recognizes the managed local-file action and validates the persisted payload for
managed-install, managed-HTTP, managed opaque-tool, and peer-envelope records —
the last through `isPeerEnvelopeAction`, which requires a decodable envelope
whose handle and thread key match the action's own recipient and topic. Ordinary
conversation and content copied from a
website, message, monitor, child, memory, or tool are never approval. `/reject`
cancels the matching current revision without running it. `/approve` records
one exact approval and hands the direct owner command to MainSession; the model
must call the matching managed executor with that same ID/revision/digest, or
retry the exact unchanged raw tool input once. Completion still comes only from
the durable executor result.

External-message rules use separate exact, standalone, text-only commands:

```text
/allow-send {"recipient":"…","topic":"…","action":"…"}
/revoke-send RULE_ID REVISION
```

The JSON accepts exactly those three non-wildcard fields. A rule authorizes only
that recipient/topic/action tuple, never another account or effect; revocation
is revision-fenced and prevents future claims. Non-message HTTP mutations and
all opaque raw effects still require action-specific `/approve`.

### Follow-up policies and recovery

The authenticated owner can bind a bounded repeat policy to an already confirmed
action with another standalone, text-only command:

```text
/followup {"workId":"…","actionId":"…","enabled":true,"intervalMs":60000,"maxAttempts":1}
```

All five fields are required and extra fields are rejected. The policy captures
the action's current revision and digest, schedules nothing when disabled or
`maxAttempts` is zero, and never treats the command itself as a dispatch. Due
execution proceeds only after the original action is confirmed. The runtime
polls enabled policies, creates a new semantic action for each ordinal, rechecks
current authorization/deadline/work state, enforces the attempt cap, and uses
the real local-file/install/HTTP executor selected from the persisted
action payload. A changed policy or action stops the old path; an ambiguous or
rejected outcome stops further repeats, while approval-required work remains due
until that exact derived action is authorized.

`AssistantWorkRuntime` also recovers on boot. A `claimed_pre_effect` attempt for
a supported local-file/install/HTTP action may resume through its real executor.
An interrupted `effect_started` attempt is marked reconcile-only/ambiguous and
is never replayed. Durable recovery reports
are passed through an internal MainSession turn before an owner notice is
admitted; no fabricated success is emitted. Completion requires a verified executor
result and surface-specific acceptance evidence, not merely a saved policy or
queue admission.

### Managed HTTP host policy

The managed HTTP tool is registered from `main.ts` with `configuredHttpAccess()`.
`OI_HTTP_LOCAL_ORIGINS` is a JSON array of exact `scheme://host[:port]` origins
and is the only way to allow private/local addresses; cloud metadata endpoints
remain blocked. `OI_HTTP_SECRET_BINDINGS` is a JSON object whose host-owned
entries contain exactly `origin`, `header`, and `environment`, for example
`{"secret://mail-api":{"origin":"https://api.example","header":"Authorization","environment":"MAIL_API_TOKEN"}}`.
Tool calls carry a `secretRef` such as `secret://mail-api`, never the secret value. The
daemon snapshots the named environment value and resolves it only when both the
exact origin and header match. Sensitive
headers, query parameters, and body keys cannot contain plaintext credentials.
Public plaintext HTTP cannot carry secret references, redirects are not
followed, DNS answers are validated and pinned for the connection, and an
unverified post-mutation result is `ambiguous`, not success.
Host operators place these values in the daemon's private `~/.openinstinct/env`
file (`KEY=value`, mode 0600); prompt content cannot edit the host policy.

### The agent's own email identity

`configuredAgentEmail()` (`daemon/src/email/identity.ts`) returns an identity
only when `OI_AGENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS` is set; a partially configured identity is a
startup error rather than a silent downgrade. The identity names the provider
send origin/path, the inbox URL, and the `secretRef` that carries the provider
credential — never the credential itself.

Sending rides the managed HTTP effect, so an agent email is one `external_message`
action in the same ledger as every other outbound effect: proposed with an exact
body (`clientReference`, `from`, `to`, `subject`, `text`), a verification GET
that must return `acceptedReference` for that same reference, a stable digest
over recipient/subject/body, and a single claimed attempt. Authorization is
capability-owned rather than a generic host message binding: `main.ts` composes
no email template into `OI_HTTP_MESSAGE_BINDINGS` at all.
`agentEmailPlanAuthorizer` rebuilds the expected plan from the identity and the
candidate's own draft fields and authorizes only a byte-identical match — URL,
method, body, headers including the credential reference, verification URL, and
the expectation. A binding can pin body fields but not the credential reference
or the verification endpoint, so a generic `assistant_managed_http` request
could otherwise claim `external_message` classification (and any owner send
rule for it) while swapping the credential or pointing verification somewhere
harmless. Byte equality also makes duplicate members, escaped key spellings,
and whitespace variants simply *not this plan*, so authorization never depends
on how a body happens to parse. Verification is correlated *and* success-bearing
in one field: the provider returns `acceptedReference` only for a message it
actually accepted and only for the reference asked about, because a managed
plan carries exactly one expectation. The reference is scoped to the owning work
item, and a repeat policy is refused for correlated capability actions, since a
repeat copying the payload could be confirmed by the first effect's status.
The host also proves the credential binding, its exact origin/header use, a
non-empty value, and, for plaintext HTTP, an origin that is both declared in `OI_HTTP_LOCAL_ORIGINS` and a literal loopback/RFC1918/unique-local address — a DNS name, including `localhost`, is rejected because dispatch decides by the address resolved at request time, so a
capability can never be registered in a state where an approved send would fail
only at dispatch. Because the class is `external_message`, an exact `/allow-send`
recipient/topic/action rule can authorize routine mail; everything else waits for
`/approve` naming that ID, revision, and digest.

Inbound mail is evidence, not authority. `ingestAgentEmail()` admits one
idempotent observation per provider message ID with
`provenance.principal = "third_party"` and `channel = "email"`, bounded evidence
text, and a hard refusal of mail whose sender is the agent's own address, so a
self-addressed loop cannot manufacture work.

### Trusted-peer coordination

The owner's assistant can coordinate with another person's assistant over the
existing iMessage transport, restricted to an explicit allow-list in
`trusted_peers` (`store.listTrustedPeers`, `upsertTrustedPeer`,
`revokeTrustedPeer`), administered through the authenticated `peers.list` /
`peers.upsert` / `peers.revoke` control ops rather than a model tool, because
enrolling or revoking a person moves the trust boundary. Handles are
canonicalized with the same `imessage/allowlist.ts` normalizer the owner gate
uses, so the trust check and the lookup cannot disagree. Trust is re-evaluated
at the send boundary, not only at proposal, so revoking a peer also stops an
envelope that was already approved for them.

The wire format is a single-line `OI-PEER/1` JSON envelope
(`daemon/src/peers/envelope.ts`) with exactly `v`, `kind`, `threadKey`,
`subject`, `body`, and a 32-hex `nonce`. `decodePeerEnvelope` returns
`undefined` rather than throwing for anything malformed — unknown keys, a wrong
version, control characters, oversized fields, or a bad nonce — because the
sender is untrusted input.

`handleOwnerMessages` in `main.ts` never promotes a non-owner message to an
owner turn. Non-owner rows go to `admitInboundPeerMessage`, which admits at most
one `third_party` observation per handle+nonce for a `trusted` peer and ignores
everything else (`not_an_envelope`, `untrusted_peer`, `revoked_peer`) — a
revoked peer is ignored even though its earlier rows remain. Outbound envelopes
are `external_message` actions bound to that exact handle and thread key,
claimed before the send and settled `confirmed` with the delivery receipt or
`ambiguous` when the transport fails after the effect may have landed. Repeat
policies are refused for peer envelopes: the nonce is single-use and the
managed dispatcher has no peer repeat executor, so an accepted policy could
only ever be cancelled when due.

### Outbound calls

`configuredCallProvider()` (`daemon/src/calls/provider.ts`) reads the telephony
provider origin, create/status paths, caller ID, and `secretRef`, with strict
E.164 normalization for the callee. A placed call is irreversible and billable,
so `proposeAgentCall()` classifies it `external_mutation`, which
`ownerRuleCanAuthorize()` refuses by construction: every call requires an
authenticated `/approve` for that exact identity, and no send rule can stand in
for it. The proposal carries the callee, purpose, the script the agent is
authorized to say, and a 1–30 minute cap as approval-legible scope and cost
material. Placement is one POST plus the provider status verification, and that
verification is bound to a per-call `clientReference` that the provider echoes
as `placedReference` only for a call it actually placed: a status endpoint
reporting only `placed` would let a prior or concurrent call confirm this
billable one, and a correlated `not_placed` must not confirm either. A 5xx is `definitive_failed` with no second POST, a
hang or an uncorrelated status is `ambiguous`, surfaced as `uncertain` and never
auto-retried, and an aborted tool invocation never reaches the POST.

### Adaptive owner notifications

Main-authored proactive notices are admitted under a stable ID, not treated as
delivered on creation. `ChatActivity` considers Chat active only when a fresh
sample says the window is frontmost and recent input is within two minutes. An
active Chat gets the initial route; otherwise an attached iMessage lane is used.
If neither route is available, the durable notice waits.

When Chat is the selected route, listing is not delivery: the route stays
`uncertain` until the panel confirms that the notice rendered. An iMessage-first
notice can also appear in shared Chat history and record `renderedAt` without a
Chat dispatch row. Render is still not owner acknowledgement: an unacknowledged
Chat-routed notice may fall back to iMessage after Chat becomes inactive. The
owner presses **확인** to acknowledge it and stop further routing. Likewise,
iMessage queue admission is not confirmation: that route remains `uncertain`
until the delivery ledger confirms the Messages row. Interrupted dispatches are
recovered as reconcile-only work, so uncertainty never triggers a blind resend.

The control surface is `assistant.notifications.list` (`{}`),
`assistant.notifications.rendered` (`{notificationId}`), and
`assistant.notifications.ack` (`{notificationId}`). Listing returns durable
`{id, text, acknowledged}` rows; the panel filters acknowledged rows from its
visible notice list.

## Outbound: ChatHub and optional iMessage delivery

`ChatHub` fans out owner echoes, assistant segments, final assistant messages,
images, and presence to control-socket subscribers. Every event has a monotonic
`seq` for the life of the daemon. `chat.history` reads the last 50 owner-facing
rows from the shared transcript, filters operator notes, receipt follow-ups, and
monitor triage, strips orientation text, and recovers the source from the
trailing `[sent from the Chat window]` marker. History returns a sequence
watermark and message-only tail so a subscriber can merge the snapshot with
live events without losing or duplicating rows.

`OwnerOutbox` is the single owner-bound iMessage boundary. With the optional
lane attached it pins the current handle and delegates owner-turn text and
images to the durable `DeliveryService` ledger, while read receipts and typing
use the attached Messages presence path. When detached, owner-turn output still
reaches ChatHub and direct iMessage admission/presence is skipped. Main-authored
proactive output instead enters the durable assistant-notification ledger: it
can render in active Chat, route to confirmed iMessage delivery, or wait without
being misreported as delivered. A per-turn binding captures the lane generation:
a turn that started detached never starts mirroring if the lane attaches
mid-turn, and a turn invalidated by detach drops its remaining iMessage effects.
Receipt, monitor, memory-audit, and operator-note output normally bypasses the
conversation bubble stream and uses the notification path; if an owner message
promotes an internal run, only output from that promotion onward is
owner-visible.

`delivery/service.ts` is the durable outbox in `state.db`: `admit()` writes a row
with an idempotency key; a flush loop sends with a bounded retry ladder and
records `confirmed` / `expired` / `failed_ambiguous`. Every text and caption is
passed through `toPlainText()` (Markdown stripped) — the prompt asks for plain
text, the sanitizer guarantees it.

`imessage/sender.ts` sends through Messages' own AppleScript bridge
(`send <text|file> to participant`). That bridge exposes nothing else, so replies
are flat (no reply-to), and typing / read are delegated to `oi-presence` when the
binary exists. Attachments are staged into `~/Pictures/OpenInstinct/` and
`mdimport`-ed first because `imagent` refuses files without Spotlight metadata.
The confirmer watches `chat.db` for the sent row.

`oi-presence` needs Messages frontmost for ~300 ms, so it only runs when you have
been idle for `presence.idleSec` (default 8 s) and hands focus back.

## Children

`children/lifecycle.ts` admits conversational and monitor-priority work under a
concurrency cap (default 4) and a live-child cap (default 16). The live cap
counts every non-terminal child; it evicts the oldest idle or cold child before
rejecting a new admission when no evictable child remains. Production work uses
`sdk-inprocess.ts`, a separate SDK session with the same soul, browser guard,
and model pin. `gjc-external.ts` remains an explicit adapter for integrations
that provide one, not the default production runner. Terminal reports are
written to a journal and become **receipts**; receipts are folded into the main
session as follow-up turns (`children/receipts.ts`), projected to ≤ 1024 B.

`delegate_background` children (`kind: task_tool`) are conversational. Their
public durable lifecycle is `running → idle → cold → terminated`: idle children
keep a warm SDK session for the warm TTL, then dispose the object while retaining
the session-file transcript; a cold nudge reopens that transcript, while the
idle timeout terminates the child. Main-session `child_status` reads a precomputed
in-memory status snapshot, and `child_nudge` only updates an in-memory lifecycle
queue before scheduling the pump; neither tool enters SQLite or a child SDK
session at invocation time. Their latency alert threshold is detection telemetry,
not a preemption promise. Conversational children alone receive `report_progress`;
updates are durably stored, UTF-8 bounded, batched for 3 seconds by default,
rate-limited per child, and injected through an owner-turn steer or one internal
main turn.

Failures and restart orphans for every child kind bypass interim batching and
become durable receipts. Every receipt is fed to the shared internal
Chat/MainSession for an internal triage turn first. That path is the only
owner-facing author and communication authority: background components submit
internal events and triage reports, never send iMessage directly. The main agent
may retry, resume, redelegate, repair, clean state, or silently ignore;
only a judgment-needed result becomes one concise natural-language owner message.
Raw state tokens, provider error codes, stacks, paths, and receipt projections
remain internal evidence and never become owner text.

## Monitors

`monitors/store.ts` keeps specs in `state.db` with revision fencing. Triggers:
`cron` (with IANA tz and explicit DST rules), `watcher` (file roots), `webhook`
(token), `script` (interval, script root only). Optional `expiresAt` disables a
monitor at its end. `memory-canonicalize`, `memory-audit`, and
`computer-usage-insight` are seeded once; the first two are protected.

Firing → `propagation.ts` state machine: `admitted → batched → dispatched
(child) → authored → delivered`, lease-fenced, replay-safe across restarts.
"Authored" hands the child's terminal report to the **main session as a triage
turn**: Gajae diagnoses, may repair the monitor with `monitor_author`, and
writes the owner one plain line — or stays silent for a self-healed blip. Raw
error codes never reach the owner.

A manual `monitors.run` request follows the same propagation path immediately,
including for disabled and protected monitors; it uses a unique occurrence key so
on-demand checks cannot be swallowed by scheduled-run deduplication.

## Memory

`memory/vendor/` is gajae-way's memory engine byte-for-byte (registry, doctrine,
autolink, validator, BM25 retrieval), pinned in `PROVENANCE.md`. `adapters/`
supply the environment: every owner turn is queued as a capture intent, written
under `daily/`, and committed; canonicalization (6-hourly) promotes into
people/projects/decisions; the daily audit reports structural issues. Tools are
thin wrappers over the vendored functions.

Existing transcripts can be reconciled with the capture axis through the
`memory.backfillCaptures` control verb. The daemon pairs owner messages with the
assistant replies that follow, preserves their original timestamps, skips
injected prompts, and uses deterministic matching so a repeated backfill is safe.

## Control protocol

`control/schema.ts` defines the NDJSON frames (hello/negotiate, request,
response, error, event) and the verb list. Fixtures in
`daemon/test/fixtures/control/` are the golden source; `scripts/sync-control-fixtures.sh`
copies them into the Swift test target so the panel codec is byte-checked
against them. Notable verbs: `status.get` (bootstrap, session, children,
monitors, `attention`), `monitors.*` including `monitors.run`,
`daemon.pause/resume/restart`, `session.compact/reload`, `settings.get/set`,
`models.list` (cached 10 min; `{"refresh": true}` re-runs `gjc --list-models`
and restarts the TTL — the panel's reload button sends this), `accounts.*`,
`providers.custom` (writes a provider block into `~/.gjc/agent/models.yml`),
`browser.open`, and `memory.backfillCaptures`. Chat activity and durable notices
use `chat.activity`, `assistant.notifications.list`,
`assistant.notifications.rendered`, and `assistant.notifications.ack`. OAuth
account login uses `gjc auth-broker login`, with a paste-code fallback.

`accounts.discover` lists existing Claude, ChatGPT/Codex CLI credentials that can
be adopted; `accounts.adopt` changes the daemon's selected credential only after
the owner clicks **Adopt**. Adoption is never automatic because it may start
billing an existing subscription. `monitors.run` dispatches one immediate run
without changing the monitor's schedule or enabled state.

The Chat surface uses `chat.send` (`{text}`), `chat.history` (`{limit}`), and
`chat.subscribe` (`{}`). Subscriptions receive the opt-in `chat.message` and
`chat.presence` event topics. Every chat event payload carries a numeric,
monotonic `seq`; the final assistant `chat.message` for a turn carries
`final: true`. A `chat.history` response is `{messages, seq, tail, inFlight?,
truncated?, tailTruncated?}`, with `tail` containing message events only so a
client can merge history and live events without loss or duplication.

`status.get` also reports the top-level iMessage lane (`attached` or `detached`
with a reason, detail, and optional handle) and the credentials probe. FDA and
Automation probe entries are omitted entirely when no handle is configured.

## Panel

`panel/` is SwiftUI hosted in an explicit `NSStatusItem` + `NSPopover`
(`MenuBarExtra` does not materialise under launchd on macOS 26). It polls
`status.get`, renders health in plain words, and raises a one-time `NSAlert` for
`attention` items. The popover always exposes **Chat…**; it opens a separate
`ChatWindowController` `NSWindow` with iMessage-like bubbles and plain text only.
The composer is blocked only when the daemon is unreachable, credentials are
missing, or the session is paused — never because the optional iMessage lane is
detached. `SettingsWindow.swift` is a normal window with tabs, including an
iMessage tab for connect/disconnect and permission status; changing the handle
does not restart the daemon.

The Chat window also polls durable assistant notifications. Visible notices are
rendered above the transcript with **확인** acknowledgement controls; as a row
appears, the panel retries `rendered` until the daemon accepts it, while pressing
the button reports `ack`. `ChatActivityReporter` samples frontmost/recent-input
metadata every 5 seconds for adaptive Chat-versus-iMessage routing. It reads
elapsed input age only and does not install an event tap or inspect keystrokes.

The Account tab also lists OAuth/API-key accounts, offers explicit discovery and
**Adopt** for existing CLI credentials, and never adopts one without owner action.
The iMessage tab is an optional branch; its identity and TCC probes are shown only
when a handle is configured.

Launched at login via `co.openinstinct.panel` using `open -W` so it gets a proper
Aqua session.

## Install and packaging

`scripts/install.sh` copies the repo into `~/.openinstinct/lib`, installs prod
deps, keeps the daemon binary's inode unless bun changed (so TCC grants
survive), renders the launchd plist with a PATH that includes `~/.local/bin`,
and installs/launches the panel and presence helper.

`scripts/build-release.sh` compiles the panel and the presence helper, assembles
that payload with a bun runtime and the `gjc` binary pinned to the vendored SDK,
and emits `dist/openinstinct-<version>-darwin-<arch>.tar.gz` plus a `.sha256`.

`scripts/install-remote.sh` is the curl entry point: it resolves the release
asset, verifies the checksum, extracts the archive, and hands the directory to
`bootstrap-from-payload.sh`, which stages the source at `~/.openinstinct/src`
and calls `install.sh`. There is no installer app and no notarization step:
Gatekeeper only assesses files carrying `com.apple.quarantine`, which browsers
attach and curl does not, so an unsigned build installs and launches without an
approval prompt.

## Safety properties worth knowing

- Never replays history; never answers anyone but the owner; never sends from
  a personal Messages account by design of the setup instructions.
- Two consecutive turn failures → further failure notices go to the log, not
  the inbox.
- Secrets: env file 0600 and refused if looser; settings snapshot reports keys
  as set/unset only; credentials the owner texts are stored per-service and
  never echoed.
- The browser can only run on the agent's own Chrome profile (enforced, not
  advised).
- iMessage-bound effects use durable, idempotent delivery rows; Chat hub events are
  fire-and-forget and sequenced.
- System/third-party observations can propose or schedule read-only discovery,
  but cannot mint owner provenance or authorize a mutation.
- Managed effects use host classification, exact revision/digest fencing, and
  verification; they are cooperative gates inside the daemon, not a claim that
  the whole process is a hard sandbox.
